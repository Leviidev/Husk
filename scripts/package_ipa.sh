# Build Husk and package an unsigned IPA, validating the bundle before shipping it.
#
# Unsigned is deliberate: AltStore / SideStore / TrollStore re-sign at install, so
# a signing team is not needed and the same artifact works for anyone.
#
# The validation step exists because a bundle missing CFBundleIdentifier or
# CFBundleExecutable builds and zips perfectly happily, and then fails to install
# with no useful message. Xcode does not inject those keys when a custom
# INFOPLIST_FILE is supplied without GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE, which is exactly how
# this project is set up.

# reaches the app, and the IPA ships the previous one with no warning at all.
# That happened once and looked exactly like a fix that did not work.
